Input Based Special Line Generator

Input Based Special Line Generator is used to generate very similar lines with the only changing content being that which is extracted from an input text file. By using the #@# special character sequence as the new line delimiter, hundreds of almost identical lines can be generated, matching inputted terms. 

For example: 
A text file containing the following:
  bbbb1
  aaaa1
And a construct line as so:
  this #@# is a special code

will result in:

  this bbbb1 is a special code
  this aaaa1 is a special code
