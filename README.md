Input-Based-Special-Line-Generator
==================================

Input Based Special Line Generator is used to generate very similar lines with the only changing content being that which is extracted from an input text file. By using the #@# special character sequence as the new line delimiter, hundreds of almost identical lines can be generated, matching inputted terms.  Created by Craig Lotter, February 2006
